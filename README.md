0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to understand;

1. At least four different sorting algorithms
2. What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
3. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
4. What is a stable sorting algorithm
